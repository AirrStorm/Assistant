# Voice Assistant - README

## Overview

This is a personal assistant built in Python using voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities. The assistant is designed to understand and respond to voice commands in natural language. Key features include web searches, system commands, time and date queries, jokes, and more.

### Features Implemented:
1. **Voice Recognition**: 
   - Uses `speech_recognition` to capture and process spoken commands.
   - Supports basic command recognition like "open browser," "what time is it," etc.

2. **Wikipedia Integration**: 
   - The assistant can fetch summaries from Wikipedia based on user queries (e.g., "tell me about Python").

3. **Joke Functionality**: 
   - Uses the Official Joke API to fetch random jokes when requested (e.g., "tell me a joke").

4. **Time and Date**: 
   - The assistant responds with the current time and date upon request (e.g., "what is the time," "what is the date").

5. **Text-to-Speech (Voice Feedback)**: 
   - Uses `gTTS` to convert text responses into speech, which is played back to the user.

6. **System Commands**:
   - The assistant can handle basic system commands like:
     - **Opening applications** (e.g., browser, Notepad, calculator).
     - **Shutting down, restarting, or logging off** the system.
     - **Adjusting system volume** (mute, increase, or decrease volume).
     - **Locking the system**.

## Features Left to Implement:
1. **Math and Query Solving**:
   - Integration with WolframAlpha or a similar tool for complex math and query solving is planned for future implementation.

2. **Voice Command Parsing Improvements**:
   - Improved handling of more complex commands and natural language processing (e.g., understanding variations in phrasing).

3. **Reminders and Alarms**:
   - A feature to set reminders or alarms based on user input (e.g., "set an alarm for 7 AM tomorrow").

4. **Messaging or Calls**:
   - Future plans to integrate Twilio for sending messages or making calls directly from the assistant.

5. **Enhanced Error Handling and Logging**:
   - Implementing a logging mechanism for errors and interactions, which can help with debugging and improving the system.

## How to Use:
1. **Dependencies**:
   - Install required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install SpeechRecognition gTTS playsound wikipedia requests
     ```

2. **Setting Up**:
   - Ensure your microphone is properly set up for voice input.
   - For the text-to-speech feature, you may need to install the necessary dependencies for playing audio (like `playsound`).

3. **Running the Assistant**:
   - Run the main script, which will continuously listen for commands and provide responses based on what the user says.
   - Example commands you can use:
     - "open browser"
     - "tell me a joke"
     - "what is the time"
     - "shutdown"
     - "increase volume"
   
4. **Adding New Commands**:
   - To add more commands or features, define a function that checks for a specific phrase or keyword in the `command` argument.
   - Example:
     ```python
     def open_calculator(command):
         if "open calculator" in command:
             os.startfile("calc.exe")
             return "Calculator opened"
     ```

5. **Voice Feedback**:
   - The assistant will reply using a synthesized voice generated by the `gTTS` library. If you'd like to change the voice, you can explore different APIs like IBM Watson, Amazon Polly, etc., and switch out `gTTS` for the desired API.

## Future Improvements:
- **AI integration** for enhanced natural language understanding.
- **Personalization** based on user preferences.
- **Multi-language support** for a more global user base.
